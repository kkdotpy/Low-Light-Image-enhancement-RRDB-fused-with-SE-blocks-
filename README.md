# Low-Light-Image-enhancement-RRDB-fused-with-SE-blocks-
The project details a method about low light image enhancement with a GAN model containing Residual-In-Residual-Dense blocks and fused with Squeeze and Excitation blocks. Furthermore, there is also a comparison made with Diffusion models showing the differences in detail in the output provided by both GAN and diffusion-based models.
